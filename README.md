# Blockbuster2DataPrep
Pulling and pre-processing the PDS data for use with the Blockbuster2 deterioration model.

NOTE: THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS NO DATA.

This package contains the code used to create a canonical PDS dataset for the Blockbuster Deterioration Model.  The Property Data Survey (PDS) was a programme by the Department for Education devised to collect data on the condition of the school estate.

The `Blockbuster2DataPrep` vignette contains the code that will load the data into R from a set of csv files (not included), then clean, format, and quanitify it in preparation for its use with the Blockbuster Deterioration Model found in the package `Blockbuster2`.
